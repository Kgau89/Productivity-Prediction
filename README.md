# Productivity Prediction

**Background: Garment Production**

The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories

**Objective**
To make predictions about garment employees’ productivity and therefore aid managers to make informed decisions about meeting the garment sales demand and ensuring that it is aligned with the productivity of employees.

*Steps Taken*

· Data Cleaning

· Data Exploration

· Model Development: Random Forest Regression

· Model Evaluation

· Cross-Validation

*Conclusions Drawn*

The model cannot be perfectly explained by the independent variables as shown by the coefficient of determination.
However, the MSE and MAE indicate an acceptable margin of error, this is corroborated by the error prediction scatterplot.
The employer can therefore use the Random Forest Regression model to predict employee productivity with moderate accuracy.
